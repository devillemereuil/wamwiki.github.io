Sample Code

MCMCglmm

Addition of a fixed effect is most easily accomplished by simply adding it to the fixed effects (so far only occupied by the population mean) section of the model specification. In general, priors on fixed effects will not be necessary.

#Same prior as before
prior1.1<-list(G=list( G1=list(V=1,n=0.002)), R=list(V=1,n=0.002))

model1.2<-MCMCglmm(BWT~SEX*AGE, #adding the fixed effects age sex, age, and their interaction, using standard R model code
                       random=~animal,
                       pedigree=pedigreedata,data=phenotypicdata,prior=prior1.1,
                       nitt=65000,thin=50,burnin=15000,verbose=FALSE)
summary(model1.2)
plot(model1.2)

#Note modes are more appropriate than means
posterior.mode(model1.2$Sol[,"SEX2"])

HPDinterval(model1.2$Sol[,"SEX2"],0.95)

posterior.mode(model1.2$VCV)

posterior.heritability1.2<-model1.2$VCV[,"animal"]/
                (model1.2$VCV[,"animal"]+model1.2$VCV[,"units"])
posterior.mode(posterior.heritability1.2)

HPDinterval(posterior.heritability1.2,0.95)

ASReml-R
model<-asreml(fixed=SIZE~1+SEX*AGE,
           random=~ped(ANIMAL,var=T,init=1),
           data=phenotypicdata,
           ginverse=list(ANIMAL=ainv), na.method.X="omit', na.method.Y="omit')

#test significance of fixed effects using
wald.asreml(model, ssType="conditional", denDF="numeric")

ASReml
To add fixed effects to a univariate model, simply modify the model specification to include any additional fixed effects before the random effects structure. The data file must have a column for each fixed covariate to be fitted. Significance of fixed effects can be tested with conditional or incremental Wald tests.
