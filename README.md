## Welcome to Wamwiki Pages

This repository contains the code for the Wamwiki new website at [https://wamwiki.github.io/](https://wamwiki.github.io/).

The website contains tutorials, code and resources about quantitative genetics, especially the “animal model”, in natural populations. It serves as a replacement for the old TikiWiki WAMWIKI (formelly at http://wildanimalmodels.org/tiki-index.php but no longer available).

From February 26 2021 we are migrating the website from Jekyll to Hugo. The website will be again under construction for some time.
