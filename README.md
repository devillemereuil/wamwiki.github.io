## Welcome to Wamwiki Pages

This GitHub account, its associated web pages, and its repositories will serve as a replacement for the [TikiWiki WAMWIKI](http://wildanimalmodels.org/tiki-index.php).

This particular repository contains the code for the Wamwiki web pages [https://wamwiki.github.io/](https://wamwiki.github.io/).

The website is built by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using mostly Markdown code (maybe spiced up with a bit of native html, CSS, JavaScript and Ruby).
