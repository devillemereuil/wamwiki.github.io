## Welcome to Wamwiki Pages

This GitHub account, its associated web pages, and its repositories will serve as a replacement for the [TikiWiki WAMWIKI](http://wildanimalmodels.org/tiki-index.php).

This particular repository contains the code for the Wamwiki web pages [https://wamwiki.github.io/](https://wamwiki.github.io/).

From February 26 2021 we are migrating the website from Jekyll to Hugo. The website will be again under construction for some time.
