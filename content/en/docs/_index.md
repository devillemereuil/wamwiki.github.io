This website is under construction. If you want to learn how to fit and interpret animal models, we can recommend this tutorial [https://juliengamartin.github.io/wam_tuto/](https://juliengamartin.github.io/wam_tuto/)

Animal models can be fitted by a variety of software. Currently we present only workflows using the statistical software [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) using a few specialised packages widely used by the community of wild animal quantitative geneticists: `MCMCglmm`, `ASReml-R`, `brms`, `Stan`, `JAGS`...

{{% alert title="If you are completely new" color="warning" %}}
If you are completely new to quantitative genetics or animal models we strongly recommend you start by reading some background information about the goals and basic principles of the framework before going through this documentation. See for instance the freely available ecologists guide to the animal model, published in the _Journal of Animal Ecology_ and available [here](/docs/Wilson&al2010.pdf/). 

Check you have the necessary software and data installed following instructions at [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started).

Then start with [Simple univariate animal model](/docs/univariate/) and walk your way through the different topics in order using your package of choice.
