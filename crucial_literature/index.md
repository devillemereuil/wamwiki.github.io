## Textbooks

### Falconer & Mackay (1996).Introduction to Quantitative Genetics. 4th edition. Pearson UK.

_An easy to read, yet thorough introduction to the concepts and methods of quantitative genetics._


### Lynch & Walsh (1998). Genetics and Analysis of Quantitative Traits. Sinauer.

_Very detailed and technical description of the quantitative genetic theory and of the estimation methods. 

### [Walsh & Lynch (2018).  Evolution and Selection of Quantitative Traits. Oxford University Press](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/evolution-and-selection-of-quantitative-traits-9780198830870?cc=au&lang=en&).

_The long-awaited volume two of the previous book. Covers many topics even more relevant to evolutionary ecologists: rates and limits to evolutionary responses, multivariate selection and evolution, Genetic-by-Environment interactions... An absolute reference for evolutionary quantitative genetics_
