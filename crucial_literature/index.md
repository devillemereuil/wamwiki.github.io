## Textbooks

### Falconer & Mackay (1996).Introduction to Quantitative Genetics. 4th edition. Pearson UK.

_An easy to read, yet thorough introduction to the concepts and methods of quantitative genetics._


### Lynch & Walsh (1998). Genetics and Analysis of Quantitative Traits. Sinauer.

_Very detailed and technical description of the quantitative genetic theory and of the estimation methods. The volume two (which should be published soon, or so they have kept saying for 15 years) contains many topics even more relevant to evolutionary ecologists: rates and limits to evolutionary responses, multivariate selection and evolution, Genetic-by-Environment interactions... in the meantime, the drafts have been accessible online at [http://nitro.biosci.arizona.edu/zbook/NewVolume_2/newvol2.html](http://nitro.biosci.arizona.edu/zbook/NewVolume_2/newvol2.html)_
